#Some Useful Ubuntu Configurations

# Change Local Host name - so APIs (like facebook) can read local.host as a domain for a development server
sudo vim /etc/hosts; localhost => local.host; :wq!
#**May cause issues with resolv lib, revert to fix

# Find a string in a directory
grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"

#Supplement a Fresh Vim Install - allow for copy/paste to clipboard
sudo apt-get install vim-gtk
